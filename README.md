# [Fox Notes](https://ryiguchi.github.io/team-fox-note_app/)
Fox Notes is a note creation application that allows the user
to save, delete, edit, bookmark, tag and filter their notes.
## Description 
Fox Notes helps you easily keep track of your notes! You can
mark notes as "favorites" as well as give your notes searchable "tags"
to organize them, which you'll find in the tag-list in the sidebar. All
notes are autosaved, time- and date tracked; easily filtred by your
words and displayed in different themes of your choise - you'll find a
light-, dark- and Swedish theme. The application of course offers the
fundamental actions as text styling, image- and video compatibility,
website linking and input of code blocks. We also added a print function
that scale downs your notes to make effective prints without wasting
color.
